"""Crawls a fixed page set after a real install: every rendered href, src and inline
style must carry no drive letter, no backslash and no application-root prefix.

Both Drupal-side path defects found so far would have failed this crawl. The page set is
fixed: the front page, /card-components, /admin/dashboard, /admin/modules, and one node
carrying an uploaded image, so an image style derivative address appears. See
docs/adr/0010-one-canonical-path-form.md.
